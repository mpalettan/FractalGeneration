What are Fractals?
========================================================

Infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

How to use the Fractal Generator?
========================================================

The fractal is generated automatically using the parameters selected in the panel on the left. There are three parameters:

- The name of a known fractal. 
- The order or dimension of the fractal. The higher the order, the longer it takes the fractal to generate.
- The color with which you want to appear the fractal.Some fractals look better in certain colors.
