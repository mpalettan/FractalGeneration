Example of using Shiny - Generation of fractals

This is a Coursera peer assessed assignment for the course "Developing Data Products". 
It has two parts:

2) Use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

The Shiny application must include the following: 

1) Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...). 
2) Some operation on the ui input in sever.R. 
3) Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations. 
4) Enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application. 
5) The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

The presentation must satisfy the following:

1) It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter.
2) It must be 5 pages. 
3) It must be hosted on github or Rpubs. 
4) It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document.
